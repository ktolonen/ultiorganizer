<ul>
 <li>Results can be added without Login just with the number on the scoresheet. Select <em>Scorekeeper</em>
  from the left menu, then click on <em>Quick add result</em> and enter the game details.
 </li>
 <li>Find the games you are responsible for under <em>Game responsibilities</em> on the left
  menu.
 </li>
 <li>There are currently two different modes which may be more suitable for mobile devices: Try
  <em>Mobile Administration</em> or <em>Scorekeeper</em> on the left menu.
 </li>
 <li>On the game responsibility page, you may select <em>Mass input</em> to input many results
  as one. Remember to press <em>Save</em> after changing results.
 <li>If you want to input score details, always start by setting the final result if it is not
  already set (via SMS or via mobile interface).</li>

 <li>Feed in score sheet details.</li>
 <li>After feeding in all the details. Navigate to the <em>Played games</em> view and make sure
  the game result and game play view appear correct.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="#helpdivision">Help for division organizers</h2>

<ul>
 <li>You can use <em>Game responsibilites</em> just like scorers to input results.
 </li>
 <li>After pool is finished, teams need to "move" onto next pool before new results can be fed
  into system.</li>
 <li>Use the <em>standings</em> (or DIVISION <em>Pool standings</em>) in the left menu to
  authorize pool moves after pools are finished. (This is not always necessary.)
 </li>
 <li>Before you do that, make sure that all the results of previous pools are correct! Undoing
  moves or changing results later can be tricky.</li>
 <li>When all results are collected, go to the following pool and click <em>Confirm moves</em>.
 </li>
 <li>To undo moves,
  <ul>
   <li>first try clicking <em>Undo all</em>.
   </li>
   <li>If this doesn't work, you can manually remove teams from a pool by clicking on the red
    crosses next to the teams</li>
   <li>If this doesn't work, you may have to delete game results in the following pool first.
    Select <em>Games</em> from just below the pool standings table.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Alternatively you can go to the <em>Pools</em> view and select <em>Move teams</em> from
  there.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to re-schedule?</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Navigate to the <em>Games</em> view.
 </li>
 <li>Click the tool icon on the line with the game.</li>
 <li>From the opening view you are able to change field and time of the game.</li>
 <li>You can enter a name for the game, e.&thinsp;g. "Game of the Day".</li>
</ol>
<p>
 If you have more than one game to re-schedule, open the scheduling view from the <em>Field
  reservations</em> or <em>Scheduling</em> link with relevant reservations selected if you have the
 necessary privileges (Scheduling right).
</p>

  playing in Bronze pool (order AB) will get standings&nbsp;3.-4. Using the right pool order is
  extremely important. In the previous example if Bronze pool had ordering AA instead of AB then
  standings&nbsp;1.-2. would be assigned to the Bronze pool.</li>
